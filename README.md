# Ridgewater College - IGNITE Your Future 2025
My alma mater, Ridgewater College, hosts an event called IGNITE Your Future every year in October.  The IGNITE Your Future event gives over 1,000 High School sophmore students from 20 schools across central Minnesota an opportunity to explore a variety of careers.  This year there were over 70 activities for the students to participate in.

This was my first year participating in this event as an activity partner.  My coworker and I represented Rural Computer Consultants, but our main goal was to represent software development as a career (as is the focus of the event).

The event was a HUGE success.  
- Overall, the energy of the event was incredibly positive and upbeat
- The Ridgewater event volunteers were very paitient and accommodating... and they fed us well :)
- The other activity partners were excited to be there and were very open and engaged
- The students were involved and open to trying out something as scary as "*PROGRAMMING*" :)

We had over 100 students visit our booth and around 70 of those students participated in the Python programming exercise I created.

With a lot of involvement and guidance from my co-worker and I, our exercise taught the students how to write Python code.  
I chose Python and Turtle Graphics because I wanted the coding syntax to be as simple as possible and I wanted to give the students immediate visual feedback for the code they wrote.  

The goal of the exercise was to introduce the students to as many of the core concepts of programming as I could, in as little time as possible.  
In about 10 minutes the students would be introduced to; importing libraries, calling and writing functions, function parameters, object-and-function notation, for loops, assignment and other math operators, if/else statements, and of course errors :).

Below is a breif summary of [the full coding exercise](student%20instructions/Exercise%20Instructions%20v1.pdf):
1. **Turtle Setup & First Steps**
   - Import the "turtle" library and move turtle forward 50 units
   - *Draws a line on the screen*
3. **Draw a Square**
   - Move turtle forward 50 and right 90 degrees four times over to draw a square
   - *Draws a square on the screen*
5. **Draw a Square... With a loop!**
   - Use a for loop to draw the same square as above but with much less code
   - *Draws a square on the screen*
7. **Write a Function That Draws Any Shape**
   - Write a function that accepts a parameter named "sides", this function can draw any-sided shapes based on it's parameter value
   - *Draws a triangle, square, pentagon and hexagon on the screen*
9. **If's & Elses**
   - Add error checking to our drawShape function from above using if/else statements
   - *Hits error condition twice and then draws a triangle*

Here is a picture of the booth that I setup with a little help from my co-worker:
